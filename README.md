I learned how to use media queries to make dyanimic webpages that look greate on all kinds of devices. I also learned how to use the bootstrap framework to make a nice grid/row layout that looks apealing. I learned how you can use grunt to automate lots of boring tasks such as minifying images and concatenating JS files to make your production site load faster. I also learned how you can use srcset to pull images from different sources depending on the size of the viewport and the pixel density of the display the image is being pushed to.
