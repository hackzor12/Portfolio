I learned how to use media queries to make dyanimic webpages that look greate on all kinds of devices. I also learned how to use the bootstrap framework to make a nice grid/row layout that looks apealing. I learned how you can use grunt to automate lots of boring tasks such as minifying images and concatenating JS files to make your production site load faster.
